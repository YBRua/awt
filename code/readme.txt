Dear Shepherd,

According to the timeline in the camera-ready instructions, the near final version of the camera-ready should be approved by the Shepherd before December 1. Considering today's date (November 27), we wanted to ensure that we are in sync with the camera-ready revision process.

Your feedback is crucial for us to make any further adjustments to our manuscript. Given the approaching deadline, we would like to kindly request an update on whether any further revision is required, or whether the meta-review has been finalized (so that we could include the meta-review into our final camera-ready).

Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.
